            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>AT a time when the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are directed towards the event of our preſent Affairs; At ſuch a time as this when the Ballance of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety ſeems ſo equally pois'd, that it is hard to gueſs in which Scale lies our Happineſs, or Ruin: I think it my duty, as an honeſt man, a true Subject to the Government I live under, and a Friend to Truth; to give you (ſince you ſo earneſtly have requeſted it) my juſt and impartial Sentiments of our preſent condition, as it particularly relates to the Lord of <hi>S—y</hi> now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Confinement in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Great Man, (I cannot but call him ſo) this immediate firſt mover (as ſome would have it) of all the dreadful Revolutions that perhaps of late years have ſeem'd to threaten us, will nevertheleſs appear to you by the following Relation which I am to give you of him, a Man as very Extraordinary in his Abilities, ſo no leſs wonderful for his Vertue. Not to mention his unſhaken Obedience to every Government he has been concerned in, or lived under; his ſteady adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to every Religion that had but hopes to be eſtabliſhed; his unwearied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the Reſtauration of the publick Peace in the time of our late unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Troubles; his admirable Counſils all along for the Improvement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good of the Kingdom; the Honour and Safety of the Monarchy, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our Arms, and the Overthrow of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>His Obedience to the Government is ſufficiently evident, inſomuch, that That never chang'd, but He did: His endeavours for publick Peace are eminently noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; For in the late Civil War (in ſpight of all Obligations of Honour and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to the contrary,) he forſook the King, and carry'd over his Regiment to the Parliament on purpoſe (as much as in him lay) to weaken the Royal Cauſe, and by the ruin of that, to bring that War to an end, that no more Rebell Blood might be ſhed, though the great <hi>Martyrs</hi> Veins were drein'd afterwards without Mercy.</p>
            <p>So much he then acted for publick Peace, but what he has adviſed for publick Good would fill a Volumn up: who can enough commemorate the ſhutting up of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to put the King out of Debt? The breaking of the Triple League to prevent the growth of <hi>France,</hi> the dividing of the Fleet that we might be ſure to beat the <hi>Dutch,</hi> though in the end it coſt us a Victory; yet certainly his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and foreſight in it, was to preſerve the Shipping, and the tender Lives of the Subject.</p>
            <p>Then for the Honour and Safety of the Monarchy; none ſo ſincere, ſo ſteady and ſo faithful as he has been: for the Honour of the King, witneſs his late Speech in Parliament, afterwards printed, and burnt by the Common-Hangman for the ſafety of the King; witneſs the cauſe of his preſent Impriſonment; But for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſafety, what Honours he has deſpiſed, what promotions neglected, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following relation, which certainly the World will never queſtion the truth of, ſince the main of it has been taken from his own mouth, that perfect <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> of his Heart, and Oracle of Truth.</p>
            <p>In a late Paper, printed for the Vindication of this matchleſs Patriot, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will find many and extraordinary Inſtances of Preferments and Honours, which this Noble Peer has wav'd and refus'd rather than ſuffer himſelf to be brib'd from the Intereſt of the common Good: But what he has meerly loſt in tender pity and compaſſion this poor Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and it's true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ought to be remembred, as long as there is a Scepter ſway'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> or the <hi>Turk</hi> unconverted.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe there are very few in this Kingdom that do not very ſenſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the late <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> in <hi>Poland:</hi> How many Illuſtrious <hi>Candidates</hi> ſtood fair
<pb facs="tcp:96783:2"/>for the <hi>Election: Sobietski</hi> indeed had done great things for that People, he had kept their Potent Enemy the <hi>Turk</hi> from entring any farther upon their Frontiers; was great and popular in the eſteem and love of the beſt Army that perhaps they ever had, but that was by much too little to Entitle him to the Succeſſion on the Throne; it appearing abſolutely the Intereſt of that Nation that the Great <hi>Turk</hi> was not only to be beaten, he muſt in ſhort too be converted, and who ſo fit for ſuch an Enterprize, as he that next ſhould be promoted to the Regal Authority? One that from the high place he was to poſſeſs, might not only Adminiſter Juſtice to them, but Salvation to the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To find out ſuch a Spirit, one fit for ſo great and extraordinary an undertaking, you may imagine the wiſe Diet omitted no diligence: the Conſtitutions of all the Governments in <hi>Europe</hi> were lookt into, as they ſtood Qualifi'd both in Church and State; and whence was it ſo proper to expect a Law-giver, ſuch an Oracle as they then wanted, but from the beſt modell'd Government, and beſt Diſciplin'd Church in the World? Therefore upon ſtrict enquiry, <hi>France</hi> appearing too De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick, <hi>Spain</hi> too uncertain and irregular, <hi>Holland</hi> abſolutely Antimonarchical, and few or no Cheeſe-mongers in it fit to make a Monarch of, <hi>Germany</hi> too near 'em; and that if once they ventur'd upon a King from thence, The Emperour upon every like occaſion might be impoſing one thread-bare Prince or other upon them to eaſe his own People: For you muſt note, that in <hi>Germany</hi> Princes are Quartered upon Provinces, as Regiments were in <hi>England</hi> upon Corporations in the time of Rebellion, and are indeed the great Grievance of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations, you may imagine, Quickly the eyes of the whole Diet were caſt upon little <hi>England,</hi> and there, upon whom ſo ſoon as the little Lord of <hi>S—y? Poliſh</hi> Deputies were immediately ſent Poſt <hi>incognito,</hi> with the Imperial Crown and Scepter in a Cloak-bag to him. Old <hi>Blood</hi> ſmelt it from <hi>Biſhops-gate-street</hi> where they allighted to his Lodging; and had it not been for an old Acquaintance and ancient Friendſhip between King <hi>Anthony</hi> the Elect (for now I muſt call him ſo) and himſelf, I am credibly informed he had laid an Ambuſh for it at the <hi>Cock</hi> Alehouſe by <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> where ſome thirty indigent Bullies were eating ſtuft Beef <hi>Helter Skelter</hi> at his charge, on purpoſe to ſtand by, and aſſiſt him in carrying off the Booty.</p>
            <p>But Heaven (which I hope has ordained that no Crown ſhall ever ſuffer damage for King <hi>Anthony</hi>'s ſake) took care to preſerve this; For the ſiniſter Deſigns of the old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Crown-monger being yet to be doubted, this prudent Prince (as I am told) having try'd and fitted it to his Head, carefully ſent it back again by a truſty Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, concealed in the hulk or ſhell of a <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe, taken aſunder meerly for that purpoſe, and cemented together again by an Art, fit for no man to know but a King Preſumptive of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things thus prepared; his Election being carryed in the Dyet ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and ſo <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> that no man to this hour ever heard of it but himſelf; It is not to be imagined how this little <hi>Grigg</hi> was tranſported with the thoughts of growing into a <hi>Leviathan</hi> he fancy'd himſelf the <hi>Picture</hi> before <hi>Pobb's</hi> Commonwealth already, nay he ſtopt up his Tap (as I am told) on purpoſe that his Dropſy might ſwell him bigg enough for His Majeſty, and of a ſudden grew ſo utter an Enemy to all Republicks and Antimonarchical Conſtitutions, that from that hour he premeditated, and laid the foundation of a worſe Speech than that Famous one which he utter'd once in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Senate, Entituled <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenda est Carthago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now upon deliberate and weighty conſideration of the great Charge he was to undertake, many difficulties and of an extraordinary nature ſeemed to ariſe. A Proteſtant King being Elected to a Popiſh Kingdom, great were the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates within himſelf which way he was to ſteer his Courſe in the Adminiſtration of his Government, ſo as to diſcharge his Conſcience, as well in reſpect of the Caſe incumbent upon him of the Souls of his People, as of the protection of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Perſons.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96783:2"/>
            <p>The <hi>Great Turk,</hi> you have heard before, was to be converted: Now to bring ſo Mighty a Potentate over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeem'd utterly deſtructive of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, which he has always been ſo violent a Champion for: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is reſolved, (<hi>Protestant,</hi> and <hi>True Proteſtant</hi>) the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Emperour muſt be, or nothing. But how (when that was done) to eſtabliſh the ſame Church in his own Dominions? there was the great Queſtion. Whereupon, after due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he reſolved at his taking Poſſeſſion of that Throne, which ſtood gaping for him, to carry over from hence ſuch Miniſters, both of Church and State, as might be proper to adviſe, aſſiſt and ſupport him, in a Deſign ſo pious, though ſo difficult.</p>
            <p>Immediately therefore he proceeds to the drawing a Scheme of the whole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of his Government; and in a large Scrowl, whereon was indorſed in Text Letters this Magnificent Title; <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> Polonienſis <hi>ſub Regno Auguſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimi Principis</hi> Anthonileski Aſhleiski <hi>primi Dei Gratia iſtius Populi Regis,</hi> &amp;c. was contained a Liſt of all the great Officers of the Crown, and of his Houſhold, which (according to the beſt light I could get into the matter) was as follows:</p>

            </list>
            <p>This was the beſt account I could poſſibly get of the matter: There were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great many more nominated to Offices and Preferments; but not being able to gain a perfect Catalogue of them, I have contented my my ſelf with barely a recital of ſuch things as upon my own knowledge I dare recommend to the world for Truth; and that, to the beſt of my remembrance, I have exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the foregoing Relation.</p>
            <p>But in the very height of all this expectation, one night as his Majeſty Elect lay muſing in his Bed, reſtleſs with the thoughts and expectation of the approaching Empire, there appeared to him by the light of a Lamp that was burning in his Chamber, a dreadful and moſt monſtrous Viſion; the Shape and Figure of it was very Confuſed and Irregular; ſometimes it look'd like the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> naked, and of immenſe nudities; Preſently, in the twinkling of an eye, the Form was changed, and it appeared like a Juſtice of Peace ſtrangled by a Crew of Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, who afterwards ran him thorow the Body with his own Sword, that it might be thought he hanged himſelf; Of a ſudden it was alter'd again, and ſeemed a Troop of Pilgrims, armed with <hi>Black-Bills,</hi> that came from the Lord knows <hi>whence,</hi> landed the Lord knows <hi>where,</hi> and are gone the Lord knows <hi>whither.</hi> His Majeſty ſeeing it vary ſo often, and ſo terribly, (calling up all the Faith he had to his aſſiſtance) boldly demanded, <hi>In the Name of</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what art Thou?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, after a terrible Clap of Thunder, attended with ſeveral Flaſhes of Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, it contracted it ſelf into the ſhape of a Doctor of <hi>Salamancha,</hi> and in an hideous tone cried, <hi>I am a PIOT; Woe to</hi> England; <hi>Farwel till</hi> 78. and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. No ſooner was it gone, but a ſtupid amazement ſeized upon the Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> and caſt him into a deep ſleep, where he lay till morning; when awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he found himſelf ſtript of all the high and aſpiring thoughts that before had filled his mind; Pity and Compaſſion towards his Native-Countrey cooled ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly his Ambition; and from that moment he laid by all thoughts of Converting the <hi>Turk,</hi> and reſolved to ſtay at home for the Confounding the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus has this good Man (for now he is no more his Majeſty again) refuſed the greateſt Promotion that perhaps any Subject of <hi>England</hi> was ever raiſed to, meerly to ſtand in a Gap here, and ſtay the Plague that was coming upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> what Juſtification of him may be gathered from the Truth of this, and his preſent condition, I leave to your better Judgment, and ſubſcribe my ſelf.</p>
